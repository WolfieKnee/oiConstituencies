<p>This map shows the candidates for the upcoming General Election using <a href="https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/elections/parl.2024-07-04/">data from Democracy Club</a>. Note that the 2023 boundary reviews mean that many constituencies have changed compared to previous General Elections so this uses our new hex layout. Select a constituency to see a list of candidates. If you don't know the name of your new constituency you can look it up with <a href="https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/">Who Can I Vote For?</a></p>
